# ISTA-DNet
Image de-noising using Compressive Sensing

The following repository is based on the code available here: https://github.com/jianzhangcs/ISTA-Net-PyTorch/tree/master


# The repository includes Jupyter notebooks from training and testing the ISTA-DNet model

# Training
The Train is performed by running train_istaDNet.ipynb
The notebooks saves models under the "models" folder (if left as default)
An example trained model for compression rate 50 after 100 epochs is available in the folder

# Testing
The Testing is performed by running test_ISTAD_net.ipynb
The notebooks loads models from the "models" folder. 


#D ata
The provided data consits of mat files with images in 256X256 format. Source of images: ISTA-NET repository mentioned above.
